• Theorem 3-1: There is one and only one path between every pair of
vertices in a tree, T. (Prove with contradiction)
• Theorem 3-2: If in a graph G there is one and only one path between
every pair of vertices, G is a tree.(Prove with direct proof )
• Theorem 3-3: A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. (Mathematical
Induction)
• Theorem 3-4: Any connected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges is a
tree.
• Theorem 3-5: A graph is a tree if and only if it is minimally connected.
• Theorem 3-6: A graph G with n vertices, n-1 edges, and no circuits is
connected. (Prove with contradiction)
• Theorem 3-7: In any tree (with two or more vertices), there are at
least two pendant vertices.
• Theorem 3-8: The distance between vertices of a connected graph 
is a metric.
• Theorem 3-9: Every tree has one or two centers.
